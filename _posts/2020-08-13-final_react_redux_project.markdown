This has been a long process, but finally has made it to a point of gratifaction of all my hard work. I am not quite done and am still adding and changing things to my application. I am thankful for everyone who helped me get to this point and will continue to get better for them and myself. 

This is a messaging/chat application that could be used for business or causual communication. I will soon be adding more functionality including use of topics and user authentication opening even more possibilities. 

This project was the biggest learning experience I have had. To gain a better understanding of the material, I had to use outside resources to attain my desired result through new concepts and methods. Overall, this has been a stressful process but a great one because of my knowledge gained.
