This has been a difficult few weeks for me. Between dealing with work complications, getting my lessons done and trying to exit the U.S. Army, I have been experiencing pretty high stress levels. I was also tested for COVID-19 which brought its own struggles as well. 

Learning another new language has taught me the importance of understanding the debuggin process that each language brings with it. I was excited to learn and create something with Java Script, but I am not statified with what I ended up making. I do have high hopes for my project and the ideas that went with it. I know once I am in a better position to make it pretty, I will be much more proud of it.
