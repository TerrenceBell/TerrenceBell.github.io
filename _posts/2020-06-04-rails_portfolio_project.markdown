This project has been my favorite thus far. My wife and I spend some of out best quality time enjoying watching animes together, so I had the idea of encorporating that into my Rails project. I thought a review application could serve as just that. Once I imagined what I wanted to create, I did not start coding immediately. I wanted to be sure of the image in my mind for the project so I grabbed a notebook and pen, then began writing the functionality of the application. This task allowed me to have a crystal clear picture of the application which enabled me to code more efficently and effectively. 

A great take-away from this project was that I learned about the gem devise and how it enables users to sign in with other accounts they created elsewhere. This gem comes with so many great methods that saved me time and energy by having user validations so that all I had to do is display errors. 

I can say happily that I am confident in the Ruby language and could explain each line of code in this application with joy. Being so confident was what made this project my favorite. I am also excited for the future of this application. I already have more ideas and images of things to add later on.
