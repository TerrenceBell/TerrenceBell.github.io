Going into this project I knew that I wanted to, like my first project, create something that is meaningful to me. My father has a church in Albuqurque, New Mexico that he started in the last few years. Since I have not lived close to them in quite some time, I wanted to do something to be a part of the church's growth. This program is meant to serve as a message board for members, and anyone who would like to join in prayers, scriptures, and words of encouragement. When a person signs up they are automatically placed in a weekly prayer box. I have many ideas to truly bring this to its ultimate state, including showing the live streams of the weekly and past services. This project served as a huge milestone for me because I was able to create something where I could make a new account, login, and navigate through. This project showed me where I am right now as a developer and helped me envision the developer I can become.
