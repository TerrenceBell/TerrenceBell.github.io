For me the choice came from the desire to push myself to be more. I wanted a job that I could do every day and generally be excited to go to work. A large influence on my decision for career change was a friend of mine. He is currently working as a developer for a company here in San Antonio. When I would hear him talk about work it was apparent that it was something  he was very passionate about. He was able to go to work and feel valued as an individual, which is something I haven't truly felt in a workplace or in the Army. Software engineering is something I'm determined to be great at because of the sense of fulfillment it gives me and the endless opportunities for growth. My goal that I would like to reach by the end of this year is to join the Flatiron alumni and continue on to do great things as a developer.
