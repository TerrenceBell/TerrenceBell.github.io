   This has been a bitter-sweet process of creating this project. The reason it has been so bitter is because of how the COVID-19 has impacted our daily lives so significantly. My work schedule has never been more inconsistent with increasing hours and complete change in our standard operating procedures. It has been sweet because of the hard work and dedication I've been able to put in to such a seemingly complex project, and I am thankful to be able to show my personal passion of finding homes for animals. I am proud of the project at its current stage because I feel it expresses my work ethic, my knowledge, and where I am currently as a developer. I feel this project came to me in 3 phases. The 1st phase was excitement over knowing that I would be able to create something new, but also scared of the blank page knowing that I alone was the one to fill it in. The 2nd phase, and by far most time consuming, was forming the CLI and scraping the web data. Surprisingly enough, scraping the Web data seemed easier doing it as part of the project than it was as part of the labs. The 3rd and final phase was refactoring my code to make it look more aesthetically pleasing. At the end of my first project I am reassured that this is definitely the field that I will pursue a career in and strive to be great at.
